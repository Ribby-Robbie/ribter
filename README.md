Personal Interpreter
Currently Following Along: Crafting Interpreters

In the future will be adding:
* Block Comments
* -=, *=, /=
* break and continue statements
* Will change the syntax of "nil" to "null" or "none" - I prefer those more
* Make break statements outside of a loop either do nothing or return an error (I think I prefer nothing)
